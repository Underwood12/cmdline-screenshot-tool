Save a screenshot of the Windows desktop in .png format.
If a filename is specified as the first argument on the commandline,
then the image will be saved to that filename. Otherwise, the image will
be saved as "screenshot.png" in the current working directory.

Requires GDI+. All linker dependencies are specified explicitly in this
file, so you can compile screenshot.exe by simply running:
  cl screenshot.cpp

To compile with g++/MinGW32 run:
  g++ -O3 screenshot.cpp -s -static -o screenshot.exe -municode -lgdi32 -lgdiplus
